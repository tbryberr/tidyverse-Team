*This project will require you to collaborate with some of your fellow students to complete a statistical analysis and report. Here are some of the tasks that you must accomplish.* 
 
- Create a public GitHub repository with an RStudio project file (team leader) 
- Put a description of the project in the README.md file (team leader) 
- Email team members and Mike the repository address (team leader) 
- Write a short introduction 
- Provide a graphical display and descriptive statistics to compare groups 
- Conduct an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for omnibus inference 
- Check the conditions necessary for valid ANOVA inference 
- Conduct a bootstrap for omnibus inference without needing conditions 
- Construct Tukey pairwise confidence intervals (if appropriate) 
- Write a conclusions section 
- Assemble a complete knittable report (team leader) 
 
*If you write any functions, put these in a **Functions** folder. Put data in a **Data** folder. These should be subfolders in your main project folder. Your finished notebook should be neat and organized. Save this notebook with your team name and **Project G** in the file name, rather than the report title. Leave the instructions in place and begin your report after the last horizontal line below. All team members will receive the same score for this project. (40 points possible)* 
 
*** 
 
The *HSB2 Data* includes variables collected on a random sample of high school seniors. Conduct an analysis to compare performance on the test variable assigned to your team for the three socioeconomic groups. Include a graphical display and descriptive statistics. Also include an omnibus analysis that assumes valid conditions for parametric inference (ANOVA) as well as an omnibus analysis that does not assume these conditions (bootstrap). Construct pairwise Tukey confidence intervals, if appropriate.

## Introduction 
 
This project aims to compare the high school seniors' test score for the three different socioeconomic groups (i.e., low, middle, and high). The analysis for this project has two folds: (1) ANOVA under the assumption that the data set fulfills the necessary conditions for parametric inference, and (2) bootstrap without any necessary conditions for parametric inference. 
 
## Results 
 
#### Descriptive Statistics 
 
Five number summary statistics and standard deviations associated with each group are displayed in Table 1.
 
__Table 1. The summary of students' math test scores by SES__ 
```{r echo=FALSE}
# Compute summary statistics 
math_summary <- tapply(hsb2_data$math, hsb2_data$ses, 
                       function(x) { 
                         c(round(summary(x), 2), round(sd(x), 2), length(x)) 
}) 
 
# Create table 
math_summary_table <- rbind(math_summary[[1]],  
                            math_summary[[2]],  
                            math_summary[[3]]) 
 
row_names <- c("low", "middle", "high") 
col_names <- c("Min", "1st Qu", "Median",  
               "Mean", "3rd Qu", "Max",  
               "SD", "n") 
rownames(math_summary_table) <- row_names 
colnames(math_summary_table) <- col_names 
 
math_summary_table 
```
The math test scores for the low SES group had a mean of `r math_summary_table[1,4]` and a standard deviation of `r math_summary_table[1,7]`. The scores for the middle SES group had a mean of `r math_summary_table[2,4]` and a standard deviation of `r math_summary_table[2,7]`. The scores for the middle SES group had a mean of `r math_summary_table[3,4]` and a standard deviation of `r math_summary_table[3,7]`. For a visualization of the distributions of math scores by SES group, see Figure 1. 
 
__Figure 1. The boxplot for the math scores by different SES__ 
```{r echo=FALSE}
read_boxplot <- boxplot(hsb2_data$math ~ hsb2_data$ses, 
         main = "Math Scores by SES", 
         xlab = "SES", 
         ylab = "Math Score", 
         col = "lightblue", 
         data = hsb2_data, 
         names = c("low", "middle", "high")) 
```

### Conducting an analysis of variance for omnibus inference 
 
Based on the result, we have a sufficient enough evidence to say that there is   
a significant difference in math score by SES ($p$ = 0.00047). 
 
```{r include = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} 
model <- aov(math ~ as.factor(ses), data = hsb2_data) 
summary(model) 
``` 
 
### Conditions necessary for valid ANOVA inference 
 
#### 1. Independence 
 
Independence means that the observations in each group are independent from the   
observations in every other groups. Moreover, observations within each group are   
independent of one another, which can be fulfilled through random sampling. So,   
this data seems to meet the condition of independence. 
 
#### 2. Normality 
 
#### (1) Q-Q plot 
 
To check whether this data follow a normality visually, I made a normal probability   
plot (Which is also called a Q-Q plot). It compares the observed quantiles of   
the data to the expected quantiles of a normal distribution. If the data points   
locate close to a straight line, it means that the data follow a normality. So,   
based on the Q-Q plot, it seems that the data of math doesn't follow a normality. 
 
__Figure 1. The Q-Q Plot for the math scores__  
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} 
# Create normal probability plot 
 
# The 'qqnorm' function creates the plot 
 
qqnorm(hsb2_data$math) 
 
# The 'qqline' function adds a reference line for comparison 
qqline(hsb2_data$math) 
``` 
 
#### (2) Shapiro-Wilk test 
 
Shapiro-Wilk test checks whether the data follows a normal distribution, by   
comparing the Shapiro-Wilk test statistic to the expected distribution under a   
normality. The  null hypothesis in this case is that the data follow a normal   
distribution, and the output of Shapiro.test function represent the Shapiro-Wilk   
test statistic and the p-value. As the p-value is smaller than 0.05(0.0022), we   
have a stable enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the data come   
from a normal distribution. To get more detailed information, I conducted   
Shapiro-Wilk test seperately for each SES group. The output shows that group 2   
and 3 ($p$ = 0.09, 0.11) follow a normality, while the group 1 ($p$ = 0.0021)   
does not follow a normality. 
 
```{r include = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} 
# Checking the normality assumption for the math score 
shapiro.test(hsb2_data$math) 
 
# Checking the normality assumption for the math score by SES 
by(hsb2_data$math, as.factor(hsb2_data$ses), shapiro.test) 
``` 
 
#### 3. Homogeneity of variance 
 
#### (1) Box plot 
 
We used a boxplot to check for homogeneity of variance visually. It can show us   
the distribution of the data and the variance of the data for each group. If the   
variances are all equal across groups, shapes and sizes of the box plots will be   
similar. On the contrary, if the variances are not equal, the boxplots will have    
different shapes and sizes. Based on the following box plots, we can suggest that   
this data does not follow a homogeneity of variance. 
 
__Figure 2. The boxplot for the math scores for different ses__  
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} 
boxplot(math ~ as.factor(ses), data = hsb2_data, 
        xlab = "SES", 
        ylab = "Math Score", 
        names = c("Low", "Middle", "High"), 
        varwidth = TRUE) 
 
``` 
 
#### (2) Levene's test 
 
We used leveneTest, rather than Bartlett's test since the data does not follow a   
normality. In other words, we can use Levene's test, even in the case when the   
assumption of normality is not fulfilled. The null hypothesis is that the variances   
are equal. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null   
hypothesis that the variance of 'math' are equal depending on SES ($p$ = 0.81).   
However, it is important to check some conditions before we use the Levene's test,   
such as an independence, data, outliers, sample size, and group size. 
 
```{r include = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} 
leveneTest(math ~ as.factor(ses), data = hsb2_data) 
```
