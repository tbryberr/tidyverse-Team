# tidyverse-Team
This is a repository for a class assignment (Project G) for a class at the University of South Carolina (EDRM 718). Various notebooks and/or scripts will be included in this repo (e.g., to obtain descriptive statistics and accompanying graphs, to ensure conditions are met for ANOVA, to conduct an ANOVA, etc.). The final product, including an explanatory introduction and conclusion, will be contained in a notebook called "Tidyverse Team Project G."
